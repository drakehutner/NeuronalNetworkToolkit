Neuronal Network Toolkit
========================

As a part of my bachelor study, this project was started.
Initially we were a group of students developing different parts, sharing the 
same goal: To create a toolkit for neuronal networks.

My part was the development of a python based front-end.
Since a had so much fun writing this stuff, I continued working on it.

For publishing I stripped all parts, that weren't created by me.
Maybe I get the permission by the authors, then I will add them later.
